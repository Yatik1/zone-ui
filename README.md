## ðŸ§  What is Zone?

Zone is more than just a frontend + backend + AI â€” it's an intelligent agent capable of:

- Understanding and retaining user context over time
- Assisting with tasks in a canvas-based interface
- Responding intelligently using large language models (e.g., OpenAI)
- Persisting UI state, history, and user goals across sessions
